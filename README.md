# C195 Final Project

An FXML java project, to create an application allowing employees of a company to create and track appointments with different customers,
made through different contacts. Note that this project worked by connecting to a MySQL database, so if copied elsewhere without the
proper database it will not work. It was placed on GitHub so I could display my work, mainly the source files in the "src" repository.
